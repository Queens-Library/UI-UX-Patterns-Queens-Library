2014 Mobile & Web UI/UX References & Developer Guidelines (Major Platforms) V1:3.24.2014

Developing a “one-stop" site for UI/UX Reference and Developer Guidelines is a major project, but it’s necessary task when you’re dealing with enterprise-level software development team. 

I’m currently pulling together a Web application and Mobile UI/UX Standards and Guideline portal for our developers, front-end engineers and partners at the Library. Here’s a list of resources I dug up as homework and easy reference to help me compare and contrast what I needed to include in our resource guide. 

This list will evolve over time. Please help me police broken links and changes to these sites in the comments or via email.
